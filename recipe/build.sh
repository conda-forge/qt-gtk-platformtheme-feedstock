# This creates a standalone shared library that mimics the results
# of configuring qt with the flag `-gtk`
#
# By creating this standalone package, we simplify the proces of
# rebuilding qt due to requiring fewer dependencies for the main package
# requiring fewer bumps when the version changes.
# The CMakeLists.txt file was inspired by the one from Fedora
# https://github.com/FedoraQt/QGnomePlatform
# and is likely to work for qt6
